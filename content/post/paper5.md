## Abstract

Understanding how your customers behave is imperative to make the most of their patronage. Today, we can leverage the volumes of data available to us, to predict how much value each customer will bring to the company in a certain period of time.

The ability to predict how much a customer will be worth in the future can be useful in the following ways:

- Provides a data-driven customer-level metric to aid in implementing proactive decisions which will impact the business.
- Enriches the customer database by adding another dimension over which to perform a customer segmentation.
- Can be taken a step further to predict how much a customer will spend on different product categories.

Having the business be more informed of a customers preferences, allows them to better cater to them technologically.
