      <description>Abstract Understanding, predicting, and learning from other people&amp;rsquo;s actions are fundamental human social-cognitive skills. Little is known about how and when we consider other&amp;rsquo;s actions and outcomes when making our own decisions. We developed a novel task to study social influence in decision-making: the social multi-armed bandit task. This task assesses how people learn policies for optimal choices based on their own outcomes and another player&amp;rsquo;s (observed) outcomes. The majority of participants integrated information gained through observation of their partner similarly as information gained through their own actions.</description>
